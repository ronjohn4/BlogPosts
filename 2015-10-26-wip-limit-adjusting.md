# WIP Limit Adjusting<br>2015-10-26<br>agile<br>
---
WIP (Work In Progress) limits force a team to think about the team throughput rather than individual or workstation throughput. A common scenario in IT is that development is cranking through the work items but testing is backing up. Sure, a lot of work is getting done but little of it is useful to the user. WIP limits should be strictly enforced. When a blocked work item is taking up a WIP count it's tempting to try and convince the team that is shouldn't count and that another work item can be pulled. This defeats the purpose of WIP limits and allows the team to move around a work item that is tough or stuck. WIP limits force the team to get creative and possibly bend the rules to clear a work item. Revisit the acceptance criteria. Is there some way to get acceptance without having to solve the roadblock? Renegotiating the acceptance criteria or splitting the work item into one that can move forward and is important and a second that is blocked and not so important helps. You might even be able to convince the owner that the second item can go to the backlog! Finally, it may come down to the fact that a WIP limit needs to be adjusted. The adjustment should be for the foreseeable future, not until next week when we meet with a vendor and unblock the offending work item. Try following these few/simple guidelines: 

  1. Lower WIP limits are better. Work items sitting in a column represent work done by the team that isn't done so isn't helping the end user. Think of inventory. Inventory represents resources that aren't helping.
  2. The WIP limit of this step should not allow the next step to starve. This one is the most understood by teams.
  3. Understand why you are adjusting the WIP limit. The reason should be at the team level not at a person level. The team has a new QA resource is a legitimate reason. Mikey has a string of simple defects that he ripped through before lunch and now has nothing to do is not a good reason.
