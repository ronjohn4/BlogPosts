# Requirements Reverse Engineering<br>2011-07-14<br>manage-up<br>

Warning sirens should be sounding in the back of your head, ‘Requirements Reverse Engineering’. Hmmm, can you say “cart before the horse”? This is exactly the situation I’ve been put into. I’ve extracted the promise that the requirements don’t need to be comprehensive, just need to document what’s been talked about. More sirens going off? What do you mean document what’s been ‘talked’ about?  
  
Over the course of a month, the Executive Team contracted to have a block of software created. The budget and timeframe are tight so the requirements gathering process suffered. The design was basically hammered out in a short series of meetings and email exchanges. The meetings did have a secretary taking notes. Now that the ‘stuff’ is about to hit the fan, the Executive Team needs a set of requirements to put in front of the consulting firm.  
  
From a design perspective, I of course wish I were involved in the design from the beginning. As I go through the documentation process I am finding all kinds of holes and bad design. Thinking about the future after our company inherits the software, I am thankful that I have this time to document what is being done. I'm certain that one of the first projects my company will consider after we take delivery of the final product is going to be fixing some ‘features’ created by the consulting firm. Here is where I’ll be happy to have a baseline, even if it’s of software I don’t admire.  
  
A side benefit is that I’m able to educate our Executive Team on things that should have been done differently. I don’t want to come off as a whiner or a road block but if some of the design issues can be influenced before we take delivery, all the better.  
  
Hey, and I don’t know of too many designers that can claim a project where the final product matched their design 100%.  I'm about to join their ranks!
