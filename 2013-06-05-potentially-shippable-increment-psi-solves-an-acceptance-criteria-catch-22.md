# Potentially Shippable Increment (PSI) solves an Acceptance Criteria Catch-22<br>2013-06-05<br>agile<br>

I was recently challenged by a team facing work that included the following acceptance criteria, "available in production".  The addition of this acceptance criteria causes a Catch-22 for the team; they can’t get approval from our Change Advisory Board (CAB) because the acceptance criteria hasn't been met BUT they can’t get the last acceptance criteria met until the work is in production.  
  
If work must be approved to be moved into production and the business is deciding on the production release schedule (as it should be) then the team can’t commit to moving the work into production within their timebox.  
  
So how do you solve the problem?  Of course you create the concept of a [Potentially Shippable Increment](http://www.scaledagileframework.com/psi-release/) (PSI) and have the team goal to make their work **Potentially** Shippable. The team goal slightly moves from _Shipped_ to _Shippable_.   This is a very important shift; it gives the team control over finishing their work and gives the business or production support control over the release schedule.  
  
Some IT shops go so far as to create a PSI backlog of work that is in a PSI state and ready for production prime time.  Business and Prod Support can decide on when the time is right for the work to be pushed to production.
