# Presenting Data and Information&#58; A One-Day Course Taught by Edward Tufte<br>2010-09-20<br>education<br>

I recently attended "Presenting Data and Information: A One-Day Course Taught by Edward Tufte". I had been waiting for the tour to come through Denver for quite awhile. I was amazed at the diversity of the audience. I met Web Designers, City Planners, Number Crunchers and Analysts; all with the goal of representing data more effectively.  
  
As IT folks we have a genetic desire to gather, clean, filter, save and generally work with data. Entire industries have spring up around managing data (SQL, OLAP, ETL, cubes, dimensions, yadda yadda yadda). So you've been a conscientious custodian of your (your companies) data. You know the data is clean, complete, and reasonably represented in a database schema.  
  
Those folks on 'the business side' keep making requests for data but you keep missing the mark. What is happening is we give them data when they want information. The human brain is genetically geared to seeing patterns.  
  
Here are a few of the major takeaways:  


  * There are 2 sides to communication and both sides have a responsibility. The presenter must represent information truthfully. The consumer must exert energy to understand and push back if the presenter fails.
  * Any presentation of data is not perfect but is used until better evidence or a better presentation comes along. Don't be afraid of improving or completely changing a presentation of data.
  * Presentation material should not require an 'authoritive' narrative. It should stand on its own and be consumed with and individual’s cognitive style.
  * Information shouldn't be segregated by it's mode of production. Data from 2 different sources melded together can be very powerful. The fact that they are sourced from 2 different places shouldn’t matter (as long as the source has been verified).
  * Paper is a very high resolution and powerful medium. Create a 'super graphic' of your data that can be used repeatedly and effectively.
