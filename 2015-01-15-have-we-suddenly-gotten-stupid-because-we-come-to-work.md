I recently attended "Presenting Data and Information: A One-Day Course Taught by [Edward Tufte](http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/index)". I had been waiting for the tour to come through Denver for quite awhile. If you get the chance, attend. Anyone involved in a conversation (hint: we all are) will not only benefit but be very captivated and entertained.

One point made is that the consumer of data has responsibilities. We are all on the consuming side of a conversation hundreds of times a day. We are responsible for asking additional questions to validate our understanding and confirming understanding with the presenter. Consumers of data are responsible for digging into data; validating the source, validating the method of presentation. Consumers must take an active roll in the transfer of knowledge.

Have we suddenly gotten stupid because we come to work? Business problems are very complex; many have thousands of data points and may involve many sources. Making business decisions requires accurate data represented in a fashion that the human mind can turn into information.

Business people demand that complex data be boiled down to a couple charts. By doing so, they are requesting that they **not** be given all the information available. If the amount of data is reduced to a few pieces that are easily understood for a specific problem we are reducing the amount of information communicated.

These same intelligent consumers are capable of understanding thousands of data points and deriving interesting information. Tufte’s example is the sports section in any major newspaper. During baseball season there are easily over 2,000 data points. People that read the sports section and follow baseball enjoy consuming these data points and converting them into information. They look for trends, seek to make predictions. This is exactly what they should be doing at work!

Come on people, step up to the challenge! Consumers and Presenters alike have a responsibility to not waste the other’s time and to effectively communicate as much information as possible.
