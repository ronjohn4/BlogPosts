# Story Points&#58; Don't even start if...<br>2011-11-17<br>agile<br>

An important aspect of agile PM is points.  They are intentionally generic, team specific, and not related to anything tangible (like hours).  Points are important in determining velocity and project planning.  
  
  
I've noticed several warning signs that cause my teams to struggle during pointing.  Many block the team from pointing a work item.  
  
  
Here are several possible problems with a work item:  


  * The Story is an epic
  * The Story will be split and given to multiple teams
  * The Story description isn't well defined
  * The Story doesn't have well defined acceptance criteria
  * The Story is not approaching the top of the backlog



One of my teams also has team issues causing pointing problems.  Team issues usually tie back to the fact that the team doesn't have a solid point to LOE understanding.  They simply get the points wrong or are guessing.

  * The team hasn’t formed
  * The team roster is still dynamic.
