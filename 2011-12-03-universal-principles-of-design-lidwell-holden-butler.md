[Ockham's Razor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam's_razor), [Garbage In-Garbage Out](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_in,_garbage_out) and [Fitt's Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitts's_law) are well known. I like the Modularity principle even though the example given is the hardware layout on a typical motherboard and my interests are with software architecture, IA and UX. The layout of this book is perfect for 10 minute breaks. Anytime I need a bit of inspiration or a mental break I pull down this book and open it randomly. Each of the 100 design principles is represented as 2 pages. The page on the left has the details, examples of the design principles are on the right. The design principles don't target a specific discipline like IA, UX or Industrial Design. In fact, this book doesn't have a technical or artistic leaning. These principles are presented with detail and then leave it to the ready to apply them appropriately. The first page gives theory, while the examples of the second page tie to specific industries or disciplines. I do have problems locating a specific design principle. If I remember the name of the design principle the the index works perfect but often I end up flipping through the book until I spot the examples. The index is simple and complete but I'm a visual person and more often remember the images used in the examples over the name of the design principle. This book should be a staple for anyone interested in how people perceived and interact with the world (products being the part of the world most of us are interested in). More information on the book can be had [here](http://stuffcreators.com/upod/). Update - The latest version has upped the ante from 100 design principles to 125.
