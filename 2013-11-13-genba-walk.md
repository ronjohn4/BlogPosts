 **Genba**  (Romanized as gemba) is a Japanese term meaning "the real place."  Japanese detectives call the crime scene genba, and Japanese TV reporters may refer to themselves as reporting from genba.  In business, genba refers to the place where value is created.  

A  **genba** ** ** **walk**  is an activity that takes management to the front lines to look for waste and opportunities.  The objective of genba walk is to understand the value stream and its problems rather than review results or make superficial comments.

A genba walk will also provide the opportunity to build stronger relationships with team members through engaging them in conversation about the work processes. This will create a better sense of ownership in team members, due to their being asked about their understanding of the work standards and how those could be improved upon and made more efficient.

What a Genba Walk is Not

A genba walk is  **not an opportunity to find fault in others**  while they are being observed.  It is also not a  **time to enforce policy**  adherence (except possibly for safety problems or gross violations).  If a genba walk is used punitively, employees will shut down and resistance to change will rise rapidly.  A genba walk needs to be approached from a place of mutual respect and interest in making things better.

A genba walk is also  **not the time to solve problems and make changes**.   This is a time of observation, input and reflection.  If ideas or complaints arise, note them and make sure they are followed up on after the walk.  Be mindful not to focus on the details too quickly without seeing the whole.

 **MBWA  ** **(Management by Walking/Wandering Around)**  refers to a style of business management which involves managers wandering around, in an  **unstructured manner** , through the workplace, to check with employees, or equipment, about the status of ongoing work.   A genba walk has structure and purpose.

Application

## Your Approach is Key

The observer must have a deep interest in understanding what is really going on.  Leave all assumptions and opinions at the office before you go to the genba.  You have to know how to approach the genba:

  * Direct observation takes a specific skill set.
  * The goal is to fully understand genba behaviors and how they relate to the current situation within the genba
  * Show respect
  * Your direct interaction with the employees is important
  * Great opportunity to strengthen your lean culture



### 1) Know Your Purpose Know before you go

If you don't know why you're there, then there's no point being there.  Wandering around without a purpose is inefficient and counter-productive.  You should never go to a genba without knowing these answers first!

  * Why am I going to observe?
  * What am I trying to learn?
    * Is the working environment Lean?
    * Is there a Visual Management System in place?
    * Are the required information, measures, and metrics displayed and updated?
    * Could you easily identify the state of progress?  Is the work ahead or behind schedule?  Is there an efficient level of Work-In-Process (WIP)? 



### 2) Know Your Genba

The genba is wherever the activity is performed that you are trying to understand and improve.  Each organization has its own unique points of activity.  Each point is a new genba.

### 3) Observe the Framework

Anyone can look around.  Observation takes skill, what and how you observe is important.  See through the surface and into the process, the equipment, the people, and the material.  Observe the activities, connections and flows; interpret individually and as a whole

### 4) Validate

Never assume that what you see is what you get.  Some things the eye can't see i.e. - thought process as one works through a problem.  If you don't know the norm, you can't address abnormalities in the process.

Avoid a false reality.  When an observation is complete, validate your conclusions with the one you observed.  You can then test your reality and validate your claims.
