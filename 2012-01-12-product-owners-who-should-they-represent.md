# Product Owners&#58; Who should they represent?<br>2012-01-12<br>agile<br>
---
Product Owners have been around since the rise of consumer society and the creation of products for purchase by people other than the product creator.  The term Product Owner has a definite role in the Agile world but is someone who represents the product in all software delivery methodologies (whether they know it or not!).  
  
For years there has been a push to move the Product Owner out of IT.  The rational is that the product owner should represent the customer's needs rather than the needs of IT.  This all sounds customer-centric but does it really define who the Product Owner should represent?  I would take a pure open economy position and assert that the Product Owner should represent the product itself.  
  
Think about it, if the product doesn't make money the company will stop offering it.  It doesn't matter how well it fits the needs of the customer.  In order for the product to 'survive' it has to compete against other possible product offerings. MBAs call this 'opportunity cost'.  A good Product Owner needs to manage a product on all sides that affect a product's ability to survive.  
  
There is really only 1 rule for product survival; the company needs to turn a profit by offering the product.  This is obvious and the first step is for the company to be able to monetize the product in some way.  I'm not interested in this angle because everyone already know this.  
  
The interesting side of the equation is the Cost side rather than the Revenue side.  
The product shouldn't:  


  * cause heavy **Customer Support** issues
  * have a difficult billing structure that causes **Accounting** problems
  * difficult for **Marketing** and explain to the user
  * be complex and difficult for **Training** to support
  * be extremely difficult for  **IT  **to maintain

All of these are costs to the company and eat into product profitability, and profitability is THE measure of how a product survives against other products (products from your company or a competitor).  The Product Owner needs to represent the product and it's ability to survive in an open economy.
