# Design Diversity<br>2011-06-23<br>ia<br>
---
A friend of mine recently encouraged me to apply for a position at his consulting firm. I declined saying that I wasn’t sure the role and I were a good match which led us into a discussion about what I wanted to do and what makes us want to go to work.  
  
Design diversity gives the designer an environment where design skills, the perspective on design, and basic experience can be increased and improved. A benefit of diversity isn’t necessarily having previous experience with a kind of problem but having a diverse arsenal of experience to draw from when deciding how to and how to not solve a design problem.  
  
Many people become known for their style of design. What this really means is that they have become good at one type of design and force it onto every design problem. Design diversity opens up the opportunity to **solve** the problem rather than **apply** my style of design to a problem.  
  
Diversity in general attracts a more engaged mind. I don’t have empirical proof, but my suspicion is that an environment with diverse problems will generally have people that are more excited about being involved, more engaged.. These are the kind of people I want to work with; people that show up for work looking for problems to solve.
