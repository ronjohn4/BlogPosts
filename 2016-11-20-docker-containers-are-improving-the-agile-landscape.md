# Docker Containers are Improving the Agile Landscape<br>2016-11-20<br>agile<br>

[Docker Containers](https://www.docker.com/) are creating secondary advantages for Agile Teams. I'm talking about the 2nd value from the [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/) 'Working software over comprehensive documentation'. Everyone knows Containers improve how teams [build and deploy software](https://www.docker.com/use-cases/cicd); basically how they manage environments. What I realized during a recent retrospective is that Containers are also improving how teams approach documentation. The team is discovering that several types of documentation are better based on a Docker Container rather than any type of document. Let me give you the example that triggered the discussion during retro. The team was spending a high percent of work time on-boarding new team members. Everyone knows that new team members inevitably cause the team performance to dip before is rises again. We wanted to reduce the dip time and start the rise to higher productivity sooner. The normal 1st day is pointing the new team member at some Confluence pages and telling them to build out their Dev machine as far as they can then ask questions. The experience for the new person is painful at best and then the inevitable barrage of questions cause the productivity dip. For a brief time we threw around ideas on improving our current documentation. Like any good developers, the second time they do anything manually they want to automate it. We decided to create a Container for a vanilla Dev environment as a starter for new team members. Creating the Container is faster than documenting the environment, is closer to what developers like to do, and the result is guaranteed to work. There are several situations where this Container/Documentation pattern may help: **New Team Members** \- This is the example above. On boarding a new team member is a crucial time, it's important to get that person productive as soon as possible. It's good for the team velocity but more importantly its allows the new team member to feel like they have something concrete they can do to help the team. **Build and Deploy Processes** \- Clearly defining how the team handles CI/CD is the first step in getting a new team member started quickly. A Container would also help when researching changes in these processes. **Environments** \- Teams struggle with variances in environments. Some of the most difficult problems result from a problem in one environment not being reproducible in another environment. Keeping all environments in sync is a perfect use of Containers. A more advanced use could be to explain a change to the architecture or even to lay out the planned architecture for a new product. **Tools** \- Teams are always investigating was to improve and this includes the Dev environment and tools used. This research can easily be distributed for review by the team with a Container that has the standard Dev environment and a single delta, maybe a new version of a library like Node. **Spike / 10% Projects** \- These are projects not intended for production but to explain a specific concept or discovery. Agile has the age old problem of defining the deliverable for a spike, now it can easily be defined as a Container that demonstrates something specific. A 10% day causes the same need. A side note; Juptyer notebooks are perfect for demonstrating concepts that are more code and logic based and less dependent on environmental changes. **Starter Framework Projects** \- If the team repeatedly builds new projects that are similar a Container with a well defined starter project could jump start these projects. Over time the team may build a library of project patterns they typically work. **Customer Demos** \- A Container can create a known environment in a known state for a demo so there are no surprises. It also separated the demo from the normal flow of work keeping the demo from slowing down other development activities. We've all heard the stand up announcement asking everyone to stay out of the STAGE environment until noon because someone is giving a demo to management. Argggg, this is the last thing developers should be worrying about. **Capture Bugs** \- A Bug Container could contain the exact code/environment/data that causes a bug. This one is trickier, the problem with bugs is discovering this magic combination, not explaining it to someone else. For instance, if you need to communicate complex issues between a Dev team and a QA team (not ideal) this may ease the problem but not solve it.  Â  Next time you are faced with creating documentation for any team related activity, consider using Docker to create working documentation. Remember, Agile isn't against documentation but prefers working software.
