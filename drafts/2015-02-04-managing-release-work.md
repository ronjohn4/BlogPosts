# Managing Release Work<br>2015-02-04<br>agile<br>

This topic wanders around a bit. Is your team following a DevOps model? Does your team release it's own product to production? Do you need to coordinate your releases with your business partners? If you answered Yes, Yes and/or Yes then you have a problem. More specifically the "I" and "V" in the INVEST acronym. In order for a chunk of work to be Valuable you should be creating a change to the software that benefits the user. Also, user stories should strive to be Independent. At the heart of the problem mentioned above is that your team probably needs to create the change is one sprint and release to production in a different sprint. The release to production is driven by your business partners. If your acceptance criteria on the work specifies that the change is available to customer, you've just ties the work together with the release (which your team doesn't control).
