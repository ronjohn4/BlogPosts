Go ahead and Google the title of this post. What do you get? Consistently you'll find a presentation given in 2011 by Netflix CEO Reed Hastings. Hastings never called the presentation _The most important document in silicon valley_ , that was Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's COO. The title of the presentation is _[Netflix Culture: Freedo,& Responsibility](http://www.slideshare.net/reed2001/culture-1798664)._
