# Kid Kanban<br>2012-04-12<br>agile<br>
---
A few weeks ago my wife was going to be out of town.  I was thinking about what I wanted to get done and started writing cards (yeah, there is a stack on the end table in the TV room, how sad).  The kids wanted to know what I was doing and before I know it they are writing cards for the Denver Museum on Nature and Science, the pool, Chuck E Cheese, etc.  
  
Because I let the kids have free reign with blue tape in the house, there happened to be a roll handy and we started an impromptu [Kanban ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban)board on the glass front of the fireplace.  They grasped the concept immediately and started rearranging cards by rank and discussing how much we could fit into each day.   
  
Here we broke from a 'real' Kanban board with progress columns because there really aren't steps to the process when doing kid stuff, you just do it.  So...after the list was ranked, I created a column for Saturday and Sunday and let the kids start filling them up.  Sure enough, they started moving the cards from the original column (I didn't bother explaining the concept of backlog) into the next 2 columns and yep...the were pulling the top cards..  
  
The weekend has come and gone but my mind keeps wandering back and doing little retrospectives.  
  
 **Pros**  


  * Got a lot done - we filled that weekend to the max.  I didn't have to get them moving or convince them that we should get in the car, they were pulling me along.  Seeing the list of possibilities sparked action.  I think they also realized that we weren't going to do the second item on the list until the first was done.
  * Got what we wanted done, done.  The kids weren't simply pulling cards as fast as they could because the card said Waffle House.  I was a bit self serving but in an open way when I wrote cards for their chores (yep, a 4 year old can empty the garbage).  They were pulling cards because they could see progress, and the card below "fold laundry" was "skate park".

 **Cons**  


  * Exhaustion - I didn't throttle them in any way.  Looking back on the weekend, we didn't have a 8 to 5 time-frame in our day.
  * No down time - this is related the Exhaustion   Because there was no built in time-frame, there was no built in down time at the end of the work day.  By Sunday evening, they were toast.   I should have talked to their teachers Monday evening, I'm sure they were not up to par.

 **What to change**  


  * There was no opportunity for and agile refactoring sprint.  We didn't build in time to take care of things like chores, homework and just hanging out and reading.
  * There was no timebox.  There should have been a built in quitting time that would have allowed them to unwind and do kid stuff.  At work, everyone goes home at the end of the day and does adult stuff.

Since this weekend, I've noticed something interesting.  We have had the chance to do this several more times and I haven't changed the process.  In fact, the kids started the Kanban on their own.  
  


  * They have learned to quit when they are at their end.
  * They write cards for each other to make sure chores are done.
  * They are OK with cards left on the board at the end of the day.  Frequently we leave cards for the next weekend.  They understand that the card isn't lost if it doesn't get done.
