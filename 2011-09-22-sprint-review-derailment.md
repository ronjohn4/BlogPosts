# Sprint Review Derailment<br>2011-09-22<br>agile<br>
---
During a recent Sprint Review a very startling thing happened to one of my teams.  We were reviewing a feature which admittedly wasn't complete.  The team had spend 2 weeks at their average velocity, was derailed by a production issue for a day and didn't quite finish.  During the review, the Product Owner and a few other members of management started talking about the feature and all the things the company needs to accomplish by the end of the fiscal quarter.  
  
Right out of left field the customer support manager asked if we really needed the feature!  In about 2 minutes the User Story was put back on the backlog (at the bottom) and we moved on.  I sat there in shock, what just happened?  There are a couple very real impacts resulting from this decision.   
  
Two weeks are lost, this is 2 weeks of a full team.  Sure, sometimes the best decision is to punt, take the loss and move on to what is important.  
  
More importantly, the team has now **lost faith** in what they are doing.   Really, why should they be so concerned with successfully completing a sprint?  It probably isn't important!  It has been proven time after time that people are motivated by success and accomplishment rather than money or being told to self-motivate.  The easiest way to motivate an agile team is for the company to value their work, to use the results of their work to accomplish company goals.  The opposite is true, ask the team to commit then don't use the work.  
  
Like any good ScrumMaster I've been thinking about this quite a bit (personal retrospective).  What are the possible causes?  
  
When asked, the managers said that the **Company Priorities Changed**.   OK, this happens.  At our company this happens quite a bit but the feature that was dropped has been a core feature in a legacy system for years and was simply being ported to a new platform.  I don't buy it, so I dug deeper.  The answer should be surprising, the **Backlog Isn't Ranked Properly**.   Yes, we have grooming sessions, release planning sessions and follow the normal Use Story format.  
  
The root cause is that the Product Owner isn't doing these things, I am!  The Product Owner is fully committed to Agile but doesn't have time to spend grooming the backlog.  This eventually falls to me and anyone on the business side of the company that I can wrangle into a conference room, the very people that don't know what the ranking should be.
