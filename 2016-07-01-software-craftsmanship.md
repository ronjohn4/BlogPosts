# Software Craftsmanship<br>2016-07-01<br>agile<br>

**_Origins_**

The Craftsmanship movement was started in 2009 by engineers responding to Agile’s focus on process, teams and metrics but lack of attention to actually getting the work done. The Craftsmanship movement isn’t a split from Agile but a commitment to engineering best practices required for Agile success. At the heart of the Craftsmanship philosophy is the notion of continuous improvement of programming and engineering skills as well as best practices.

**_Manifest for Software Craftsmanship_**

Just as the Agile movement has a manifesto, the Craftsmanship movement has the same:

The Further Reading link at the bottom has quite a bit of information and is kept current but there really isn’t that much available and the organization could be better.

**_The Analogy_**

The Craftsmanship movement uses the Craftsman analogy of learning and skills transferred from Master to Apprentice and the Journeyman’s journey to gain a variety of skills and learning. This analogy of Craftsman was chosen over Engineer because:

  * A civil engineer seldom drives rivets into bridges
  * A nautical engineer seldom works on boats
  * An electrical engineer seldom wires anything
  * But… a computer engineer not only has the knowledge and experience to design software solutions but also writes code



The [**Apprentice**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apprenticeship) would apprentice himself to a Master with the purpose of gaining basic skills and to get a solid start down his chosen path. Routine work in the shop would create a base for the apprentice to build on. A common example is in a blacksmith shop. The apprentice would be tasked with operating the bellows of the foundry. This may seem like boring work (and it may be) but the attentive apprentice would build an understanding of how hot the metal needs to be to work, how to easily operate the bellows and to fix them when needed.

The [**Journeyman**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journeyman) would leave his apprenticeship with a stamp in his guild book stating that he had built up core knowledge and was capable of specific types of work. The Journeyman would then venture out into the world working in various shops that offered to expand his knowledge and skill. Each time a specific skill was mastered the Master of the shop would detail the work and stamp the guild book.

A [**Master**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_craftsman) is accepted by the guild after review of the guild book and a masterpiece. Only now could the Craftsman open his own shop and begin to expand the skill, techniques and knowledge of the trade in general. At this time the Master can give back to the trade by accepting Apprentices into his shop.

The [**Guild**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guild) is the governing or controlling body for a particular craft or trade and usually covered a specific geographic region.

The [**masterpiece**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masterpiece) is a work considered to be the greatest piece of work in a person’s career.

**_Methods_**

[**Kata** ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata)is a Japanese word describing detailed choreographed patterns of movements practiced either solo or in pairs. To a Craftsman this is a problem designed to hone programming skills. The work can be done individually or in teams. Read a few of the Kata [ here](http://codekata.com/) to better understand what they are all about. Better yet, work on a couple of them!

**Craftsmanship** **Meetups** are starting to gain momentum. Groups get together and practice. They shake it up to keep the Kata and practice fresh, and minds active and engaged.
