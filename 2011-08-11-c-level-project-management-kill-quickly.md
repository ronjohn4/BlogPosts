# C Level Project Management&#58; Kill Quickly<br>2011-08-11<br>manage-up<br>

I was recently having a discussion about what involvement C Level should have with IT projects. Actually it turns out that IT projects and non-IT projects are the same at this level C Level doesn’t care if you write a tricky order entry aggregator or offshore order entry work for $55/week as long as the work gets done the most efficiently. So, you have a talented staff proposing all sorts of fantastic projects, your resources are limited and you want to do what’s best for the company.  
  
C Level should be trying to **kill projects** as quickly, painlessly and cheaply as possible.  
  
This may sound counter productive when steering a company toward success but think about it as a resource issue. The company has limited resources and the longer this individual project is allowed to exist, the larger its slice of the goodies. If the project isn’t in the best interest of the company, the earlier it can be killed the better.  
  
I’ve seen projects stay on the books for years. Some executive will breathe life back into it and C Level will have another review. More research will be called for (duplicating work done in the recent past) and company focus will be taken away from other potential projects. Don’t get me wrong, things change. The business and technical environments change. The hurdle that caused a project to be shelved a year ago may be gone but churning a project is wasteful.  
  
Quickly separating the wheat from the chaff allows C Level to focus on traditional project comparison. Cost Benefit analysis, ROI estimates, SWAP tables, soft secondary benefits, etc. This is where the real project work should be happening. The problem of project selection isn’t so simple when projects are compared against each other. There are many more variables, benefit overlaps, resource conflicts, etc. Comparing a project against itself is much easier and quick.  
  
Kill quickly, put a trigger in place that will cause the project to come back when a review makes sense, and move on. In a talented company, ideas should be a dime a dozen. The faster a project moves from idea to execution, the sooner value will be realized.
