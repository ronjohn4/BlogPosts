# Signs that your Team isn't Forming<br>2011-10-13<br>agile<br>

Recently I've been having challenges with my teams disbanding.  External forces (upper management) are causing them to focus on non-team tasks (pet projects).  This lead me to wonder about the warning signs.  


  


  1. The team speaks in terms of “Me” and “I” rather than “We”.  You hear this lingo during all of the ceremonies except for one, the Retrospective.  These words are also used when explaining problems or discussing solutions.
  2. Each team member considers the work “done” when their tasks are done.  When talking about Stories it’s easy for team members to describe the status as complete when their individual task is complete.
  3. Retrospectives tend to focus on fixing external factors such as the condition of the backlog or scope change. 
  4. Updating task status isn’t important.  The ScrumMaster is continually asking the team to update status and/hours.  If the team members were concerned about team progress they would be updating status asap.
  5. The Sprint Review meeting isn’t of concern as long as there is some ‘reason’ that their tasks aren’t complete
  6. There is no incentive to help others on the team.  There may actually be a disincentive if there is a possibility of not finish your task.
  7. There is a positive incentive to move work off your plate.  It doesn’t matter to the team member if the work goes to other team members or out of the team.  Of course for the team, moving work out of the team is much better than moving it around the team.



The resolution is simple; but not.  I need to raise the issue with upper management and get them to commit to a course that changes their own behavior - right!
