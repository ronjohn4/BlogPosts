# Mobile Devices and the Multitasking Problem<br>2013-02-20<br>ux<br>
---
The title sounds a little like a Sherlock Holmes short story.  And, maybe the problem/solution is elementary my dear someone.  I have a problem which I share with 95% of the mobile carrying world that hasn't been said out loud.  I can't hold my mobile to my ear and see the display at the same time.  
  
The 5% that don't have this problem are either comfortable looking like 7 of 9 and having public conversation with themselves using a Bluetooth earpiece or are not capable of multitasking.  
  
As a society we are bored and easily distracted.  Now that I can talk to someone with my mobile and I can play Fruit Ninja with my mobile, I want to do both at the same time with my mobile.  I want to do 2+ things at the same time; talk to someone and interact with Apps.  
  
Solution 1 - Bluetooth earpieces will probably become more acceptable as time goes by.  Just wait.  
  
Solution 2 - Solve the Bluetooth earpiece "I'm in a conversation cue" issue.  The problem with earpieces is that the public doesn't have a visual cue that you are talking to someone not present.  Change the earpiece to give that visual cue, change the earpiece look like a cell phone at your ear with an artificial hand holding it.  Not a very workable solution.  
  
Solution 3 - Separate the handset from the display.  Use a cell enabled tablet (Phablet) with a Bluetooth handset that does nothing more than allow you to talk, hear, hold and hangup.  Use your typical phone app on the tablet to search for people, call, associate notes and photos with a contact, etc.  
  
I'm not interested in one of those retro handsets that look like MaBell is back in business.  I want something that looks like a simple cell phone but connects to my Phablet via bluetooth.  
  
Interestingly, now that the handset is separate from the Apps, the device running the apps become more malleable   It can be a larger device like a table, but it can also become many other things that don't have to be held to your ear.  It can be a watch with App display, a full on tablet, your car cell connection, anything that can make a cell call.
