# Requirements after the Demo<br>2012-06-01<br>projects<br>

I find myself in the strange position of writing requirements for a piece of software a consulting firm is writing for my company. Not all that strange until you find out that the event that caused this work was a demo of said software.  
  
Yep, I’m writing requirements for some software that was just demoed.  
  


After the demo, everyone fragmented into several conversations but most danced around the question “Is that what we asked for?”.  A specific example of requirement confusion is “I can’t remember if we finally landed on having a facet change affect the base criteria or not”.  
  
Traditionally you would compare the delivered product with the requirements.  There is usually some level of wiggle where a couple requirements were missed or misunderstood, the consulting firm drops the price or agrees to some level of post production support.  Eventually everyone gets to the point where they can decide to pay or not.  
  
SO... what do we do?  We decide to use this same flow, oh but wait.... we need requirements to compare to the software.  Great, lets write up the requirements based on what we just saw then do the comparison.  Any guesses on how well the software and requirements are going to match?
