# Is your team Agile...or Elastic?<br>2015-04-12<br>agile<br>
---
Agile is designed to change and adapt with evolving business and technology needs. Process and team changes are recognized as good or bad and either adopted permanently or abandon (retro). **Agile teams** own change, the look for changes that improve their performance and they make those changes their own. These change quickly become a part of the team's fabric and are no longer viewed as changes but 'just the way we get things done'. **Elastic teams** agree to changes that shift from current state to some desired state but left to their own preferences will snap back to the original state every time. The shift back is usually driven by cultural legacy, resistance to change, inability to learn and grow, or simply the lack of desire to change (the comfort zone). How do you know if your team is Agile or Elastic? Go ahead and take that vacation to Cabo you've been thinking about. When you return will your team be humming along like it was before you left (agile)? Or, are you imagining one of these scenarios (elastic): 

  * Lets agrees that this week we should just focus on getting things done and don't need a stand up
  * The retro is for the Scrum Master so lets wait until she returns from Cabo
  * We should refactor Module X before we continue on with the work in the backlog even though we didn't plan for it
  * Kanban suits the type of work we do also, then we don't have to groom or sprint plan
  * add any other behavior that a scrum master would recognize as working around agile <here>

So, now you know. If you have an elastic team what do you do about it? The same wonderful agile activities you've been doing all along. We keep pushing our teams to live up to their full potential...gently, not from a position of control but by showing, convincing..leading.
