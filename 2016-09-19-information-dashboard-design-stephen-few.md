Information Dashboard Design Stephen Few 2006 Recently my team has been given the fantastic opportunity to build some internal analytics dashboards. These will be coded, optimized and distributed dashboards rather than query based Tableau style representations of information out of a big data store. So I pulled down an old friend from several years ago to brush up on some of the basic principles of dashboard design. I have to say that I had forgotten how amazing this book is. I realized it the first time through and used it on several projects years ago. But over time with no dashboard projects the beauty of the book faded. There are several books that discuss topics like the best types of charts for different types of data, learning what your audience needs and organizing data visually to be the most effective in different context; this book covers these as well. Few's book goes to an entirely new level with examples of anti-patterns, the psychological reasons for why one visual representation is better than another and simply taking the stance that anything on the screen that doesn't contribute to understanding risks contributing to the noise. "Performance Dashboards" by Wayne W. Eckerson gets into the mechanics of creating and delivering dashboards. Few's book remains entirely in the theory and practice of designing dashboards. This makes these 2 books nice compliments. The examples used throughout the book are direct and to the point. The visuals are often stunning in their simplicity and a joy to look at. I would recommend this book to anyone that wants to delve deep into core principles that make a dashboard usable or not. It is technology agnostic and keeps the focus on the topic rather than tools and techniques.
