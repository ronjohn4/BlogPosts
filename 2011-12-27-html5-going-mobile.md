# HTML5 going Mobile<br>2011-12-27<br>html5<br>

HTML 5 is suspiciously compatible with mobile devices, and I like it.  
  
Prior to HTML 5 the capabilities of the browser were inferred by the make, model and year of the browser.  IE 7.0 is subtly different than the latest version of Chrome.  Formally this is known as User Agent (UA) querying.  This is kind of like asking a machine if it is Mac or Win, then asking which version of Windows, and from this trying to decide what it can do.  
  
HTML 5 brings Feature Detection.  You really don't care if the browser is Chrome or FireFox, what you really want to know is if it has a specific feature.  This really sounds a lot like working with Android.  Is the hardware location aware?  What size is the display.  Are we connected to the internet?  These are all features and have little to do with the make, model and year.  
  
The UI language has always been quite proprietary with mobile devices.  Sure you could use tools that would attempt to port the app between platforms but the UI was always the hurdle.  As we were all learning to program against iOS, Andoid, Windows Mobile and the others; the mobile OS was building support for the browser, which renders HTML which is a language for displaying a UI.  It doesn't take a genius to see where this is going.  
  
Fueling this is the additional support HTML 5 brings to common tasks we would have to roll by hand for each OS supported.  It's easy to see a development environment/language/OS that allows cross device, native support to these common tasks.
